OEM Info for elementary OS System Settings

## To use:

1. Find your device in the list of folders
2. Copy the device's folder's contents to `/etc/` (on elementary OS, open Files as Administrator or use `sudo` from Terminal)
3. Open _System Settings_ → _System_ → _Hardware_ on elementary OS 6 to see the prettiness

## Contributing

I made this for the various devices I use/have used that didn't provide good data out of the box, but pull requests are welcome for more hardware!

See the [Switchboard About Plug's OEM Configuration section](https://github.com/elementary/switchboard-plug-about/#oem-configuration) for more info.

### Images

Images should:

- Ideally represent the hardware itself, but an OEM logo is an acceptible fallback
- Be at least 256×256 to ensure they show well on HiDPI displays
- Have a transparent background
- Work on both light and dark backgrounds
